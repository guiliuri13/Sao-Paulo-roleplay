> A resource that detects different types of cheating

## About
TigoAntiCheat is a resource written in Lua for detecting cheaters. Because many different executors automatically stop anticheat resources, version 2.0 has changed dramatically. TigoAntiCheat is now only Server side and all client side files of TigoAntiCheat are built dynamically. This way the client files of TigoAntiCheat are hidden and encrypted.

⚠️ Updating from 1.1 to 2.0 only possible with Whitelisted IPs and Bans

## Disclamer
TigoAntiCheat is a resource written to assist in finding possible cheaters. It does not mean that TigoAntiCheat makes cheating on your server impossible. Nor does it mean that TigoAntiCheat will be updated as soon as a new or different way of cheating is available. Project will be updated and modified as soon as there is time and reason to update the resource. It is allowed to rename, copy and distribute TigoAntiCheat as long as the original LICENSE is added to that project.
